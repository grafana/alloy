Foreach with two items. Both pulse components will send "1" till they both reach 5, adding to 10 in the summation component.

-- main.alloy --
foreach "testForeach" {
  collection = [5, 5]
  var = "num"

  template {
    testcomponents.pulse "pt" {
      max = num
      frequency = "10ms"
      forward_to = [testcomponents.summation_receiver.sum.receiver]
    }
  }
}

testcomponents.summation_receiver "sum" {
