// schedule OpenTelemetry Collector components; it does not implement the full
// component.Component interface.
//
// Each OpenTelemetry Collector component has one instance per supported
// telemetry signal, which is why Scheduler supports multiple components. For
// example, when creating the otlpreceiver component, you would have three
// total instances: one for logs, one for metrics, and one for traces.
// Scheduler should only be used to manage the different signals of the same
// OpenTelemetry Collector component; this means that otlpreceiver and
// jaegerreceiver should not share the same Scheduler.
