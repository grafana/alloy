# For builds produced against release branches, the major and minor version
# indicated in this file match the release branch. For example, for the branch
# release/v1.0, this file will report v1.0.0. The patch version indicated by this
# file syncs with the patch release being planned. For example, if a v1.0.1
# patch release is planned, this file will report v1.0.1 before that release is
# produced.
#
# For builds produced against main branches, the major and minor version
# reported by this file matches the next minor or major version to be released.
# For example, if v1.0.0 was just released, this file (in the main branch) will
# report v1.1.0, the next release planned.
#
# The string in this file MUST be a valid semantic version prefixed with "v",
# without any pre-release or build information.
#
# This file is ignored when building binaries from a Git tag.

# Lines starting with "#" and blank lines are ignored.
