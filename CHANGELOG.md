### Enhancements

- Update `prometheus.exporter.kafka` with the following functionalities (@wildum):
  * GSSAPI config
  * enable/disable PA_FX_FAST
  * set a TLS server name
  * show the offset/lag for all consumer group or only the connected ones
  * set the minimum number of topics to monitor
  * enable/disable auto-creation of requested topics if they don't already exist
  * regex to exclude topics / groups
  * added metric kafka_broker_info

- In `prometheus.exporter.kafka`, the interpolation table used to compute estimated lag metrics is now pruned
  on `metadata_refresh_interval` instead of `prune_interval_seconds`. (@wildum)

- Don't restart tailers in `loki.source.kubernetes` component by above-average
  time deltas if K8s version is >= 1.29.1 (@hainenber)

### Bugfixes

  Add/Remove programs list. (@rfratto)

- In `mimir.rules.kubernetes`, fix an issue where unrecoverable errors from the Mimir API were retried. (@56quarters)

- Add a description to Alloy DEB and RPM packages. (@rfratto)
