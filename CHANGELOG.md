This document contains a historical list of changes between releases. Only
changes that impact end-user behavior are listed; changes to documentation or
internal API changes are not present.

Main (unreleased)
-----------------

### Breaking changes to non-GA functionality

- Update Public preview `remotecfg` to use `alloy-remote-config` instead of `agent-remote-config`. The
  API has been updated to use the term `collector` over `agent`. (@erikbaranowski)

### Enhancements

- (_Public preview_) Add native histogram support to `otelcol.receiver.prometheus`. (@wildum)

- Added `scrape_protocols` option to `prometheus.scrape`, which allows to
  control the preferred order of scrape protocols. (@thampiotr)

### Bugfixes

- Fix panic when component ID contains `/` in `otelcomponent.MustNewType(ID)`.(@qclaogui)

- Fixed an issue with `prometheus.scrape` in which targets that move from one
  cluster instance to another could have a staleness marker inserted and result
  in a gap in metrics (@thampiotr)

- Exit Alloy immediately if the port it runs on is not available. 
  This port can be configured with `--server.http.listen-addr` or using
  the default listen address`127.0.0.1:12345`. (@mattdurham)

- Fix a panic in `loki.source.docker` when trying to stop a target that was never started. (@wildum)

### Other changes

- `prometheus.exporter.snmp`: Updating SNMP exporter from v0.24.1 to v0.26.0.

- `prometheus.scrape` component's `enable_protobuf_negotiation` argument is now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
  Use `scrape_protocols` instead and refer to `prometheus.scrape` reference
  documentation for further details. (@thampiotr)

- Updated Prometheus dependency to [v2.51.2](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.51.2) (@thampiotr)


v1.1.0
------

### Features

- (_Public preview_) Add support for setting GOMEMLIMIT based on cgroup setting. (@mattdurham)

- (_Public preview_) Introduce BoringCrypto Docker images.
  The BoringCrypto image is tagged with the `-boringcrypto` suffix and
  is only available on AMD64 and ARM64 Linux containers.
  (@rfratto, @mattdurham)

- (_Public preview_) Introduce `boringcrypto` release assets. BoringCrypto
  builds are publshed for Linux on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms. (@rfratto,
  @mattdurham)

- `otelcol.exporter.loadbalancing`: Add a new `aws_cloud_map` resolver. (@ptodev)

- Introduce a `otelcol.receiver.file_stats` component from the upstream
  OpenTelemetry `filestatsreceiver` component. (@rfratto)

### Enhancements

- Update `prometheus.exporter.kafka` with the following functionalities (@wildum):
  * GSSAPI config
  * enable/disable PA_FX_FAST
  * set a TLS server name
  * show the offset/lag for all consumer group or only the connected ones
  * set the minimum number of topics to monitor
  * enable/disable auto-creation of requested topics if they don't already exist
  * regex to exclude topics / groups
  * added metric kafka_broker_info

- In `prometheus.exporter.kafka`, the interpolation table used to compute estimated lag metrics is now pruned
  on `metadata_refresh_interval` instead of `prune_interval_seconds`. (@wildum)

- Don't restart tailers in `loki.source.kubernetes` component by above-average
  time deltas if K8s version is >= 1.29.1 (@hainenber)

- In `mimir.rules.kubernetes`, add support for running in a cluster of Alloy instances
  by electing a single instance as the leader for the `mimir.rules.kubernetes` component
  to avoid conflicts when making calls to the Mimir API. (@56quarters)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed issue with defaults for Beyla component not being applied correctly. (marctc)

- Fix an issue on Windows where uninstalling Alloy did not remove it from the
  Add/Remove programs list. (@rfratto)

- Fixed issue where text labels displayed outside of component node's boundary. (@hainenber)

- Fix a bug where a topic was claimed by the wrong consumer type in `otelcol.receiver.kafka`. (@wildum)

- Fix an issue where nested import.git config blocks could conflict if they had the same labels. (@wildum)

- In `mimir.rules.kubernetes`, fix an issue where unrecoverable errors from the Mimir API were retried. (@56quarters)

- Fix an issue where `faro.receiver`'s `extra_log_labels` with empty value
  don't map existing value in log line. (@hainenber)

- Fix an issue where `prometheus.remote_write` only queued data for sending
  every 15 seconds instead of as soon as data was written to the WAL.
  (@rfratto)

- Imported code using `slog` logging will now not panic and replay correctly when logged before the logging
  config block is initialized. (@mattdurham)

- Fix a bug where custom components would not shadow the stdlib. If you have a module whose name conflicts with an stdlib function
  and if you use this exact function in your config, then you will need to rename your module. (@wildum)

- Fix an issue where `loki.source.docker` stops collecting logs after a container restart. (@wildum)

- Upgrading `pyroscope/ebpf` from 0.4.6 to 0.4.7 (@korniltsev):
  * detect libc version properly when libc file name is libc-2.31.so and not libc.so.6
  * treat elf files with short build id (8 bytes) properly

### Other changes

- Update `alloy-mixin` to use more specific alert group names (for example,
  `alloy_clustering` instead of `clustering`) to avoid collision with installs
  of `agent-flow-mixin`. (@rfratto)
- Upgrade Beyla from v1.4.1 to v1.5.1. (@marctc)

- Add a description to Alloy DEB and RPM packages. (@rfratto)

- Allow `pyroscope.scrape` to scrape `alloy.internal:12345`. (@hainenber)

- The latest Windows Docker image is now pushed as `nanoserver-1809` instead of
  `latest-nanoserver-1809`. The old tag will no longer be updated, and will be
  removed in a future release. (@rfratto)

- The log level of `finished node evaluation` log lines has been decreased to
  'debug'. (@tpaschalis)

- Update post-installation scripts for DEB/RPM packages to ensure
  `/var/lib/alloy` exists before configuring its permissions and ownership.
  (@rfratto)

- Remove setcap for `cap_net_bind_service` to allow alloy to run in restricted environments.
  Modern container runtimes allow binding to unprivileged ports as non-root. (@BlackDex)

- Upgrading from OpenTelemetry v0.96.0 to v0.99.0.
  - `otelcol.processor.batch`: Prevent starting unnecessary goroutines.
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9739
  - `otelcol.exporter.otlp`: Checks for port in the config validation for the otlpexporter.
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/9505
  - `otelcol.receiver.otlp`: Fix bug where the otlp receiver did not properly respond
    with a retryable error code when possible for http.
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/9357
  - `otelcol.receiver.vcenter`: Fixed the resource attribute model to more accurately support multi-cluster deployments.
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30879
    For more information on impacts please refer to:
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/31113
    The main impact is that `vcenter.resource_pool.name`, `vcenter.resource_pool.inventory_path`,
    and `vcenter.cluster.name` are reported with more accuracy on VM metrics.
  - `otelcol.receiver.vcenter`: Remove the `vcenter.cluster.name` resource attribute from Host resources if the Host is standalone (no cluster).
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/32548
  - `otelcol.receiver.vcenter`: Changes process for collecting VMs & VM perf metrics to be more efficient (one call now for all VMs).
    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/31837
  - `otelcol.connector.servicegraph`: Added a new `database_name_attribute` config argument to allow users to
    specify a custom attribute name for identifying the database name in span attributes.
