# Alloy Release Tool

This tool automates the release process for Grafana Alloy following the [official release process](../docs/developer/release/README.md).

## Overview

The release tool helps automate the following release workflows:

1. First release candidate (`rc.0`)
2. Additional release candidates (`rc.1`, `rc.2`, etc.)
3. Stable Release Publish (`1.2.0`, `1.6.0`, etc.)
4. Patch Release Publish - latest version (`1.15.1`, `1.15.2`, etc.)

## Usage

TBD as features are implemented.

## Development

This tool is under active development. The initial implementation will focus on automating the most error-prone and time-consuming parts of the release process while maintaining manual oversight for critical decisions.
