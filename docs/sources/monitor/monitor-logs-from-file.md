# Monitor logs from a local file with {{% param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

Log files document events, activities, and usage patterns within a system, application, or network.
These files are essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and understanding system behavior.
You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect logs, forward them to a Grafana stack, and create a Grafana dashboard to monitor system behavior.

The [`alloy-scenarios`][scenarios] repository contains complete working examples of {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} deployments.
Clone the repository and use the example deployments to understand how {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} collects, processes, and exports telemetry signals.

In this example scenario, {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} collects logs from a local file and forwards them to a Loki destination.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the following:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
You need administrator privileges to run `docker` commands.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Clone and deploy the example

Follow these steps to clone the scenarios repository and deploy the monitoring example:

1. Clone the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} scenarios repository.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/alloy-scenarios.git
   ```

1. Start Docker to deploy the Grafana stack.

   ```shell
   cd alloy-scenarios/logs-file
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Check the status of the Docker containers:

   ```shell
   docker ps
   ```

1. (Optional) Stop Docker to shut down the Grafana stack when you finish exploring this example.

   ```shell
   docker compose down
   ```

## Monitor and visualize your data

Use Grafana to monitor your deployment's health and visualize your data.

### Monitor {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

To monitor the health of your {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} deployment, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345).

For more information about the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI, refer to [Debug Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/troubleshoot/debug/).

### Visualize your data

To use the Grafana Logs Drilldown, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app](http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app).

To create a [dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/#create-a-dashboard) for visualizing metrics and logs, open your browser and go to [`http://localhost:3000/dashboards`](http://localhost:3000/dashboards).

## Understand the {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} configuration

This example uses a `config.alloy` file to configure the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} components for logging.
You can find this file in the cloned repository at `alloy-scenarios/logs-file/`.

The configuration includes `livedebugging` to stream real-time data to the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.

### Configure `livedebugging`

`livedebugging` streams real-time data from your components directly to the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.
Refer to the [Troubleshooting documentation][troubleshooting] for more details about this feature.

[troubleshooting]: https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/troubleshoot/debug/#live-debugging-page

#### `livedebugging`

By default, `livedebugging` is disabled.
Enable it explicitly through the `livedebugging` configuration block to make debugging data visible in the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.

```alloy
livedebugging {
  enabled = true
}
```

### Configure logging

The logging configuration in this example requires three components:

* `local.file_match`
* `loki.source.file`
* `loki.write`

#### `local.file_match`

The [`local.file_match`][local.file_match] component discovers files on the local filesystem using glob patterns.
In this example, the component requires the following arguments:

* `path_targets`: Targets to expand. Looks for glob patterns on the `__path__` key.
* `sync_period`: How often to sync the filesystem and targets.

```alloy
local.file_match "local_files" {
    path_targets = [{"__path__" = "/temp/logs/*.log", "job" = "python", "hostname" = constants.hostname}]
    sync_period  = "5s"
}
```

#### `loki.source.file`

The [`loki.source.file`][loki.source.file] component reads log entries from files and forwards them to other Loki components.
In this example, the component requires the following argument:

* `targets`: The list of files to read logs from.
* `forward_to`: The list of receivers to send log entries to.
* `tail_from_end`: Whether a log file is tailed from the end if a stored position isn't found.

```alloy
loki.source.file "log_scrape" {
    targets    = local.file_match.local_files.targets
    forward_to = [loki.write.local.receiver]
    tail_from_end = true
}
```

#### `loki.write`

The [`loki.write`][loki.write] component writes logs to a Loki destination.
In this example, the component requires the following argument:

* `url`: Defines the full URL endpoint in Loki to send logs to.

```alloy
loki.write "local" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```
