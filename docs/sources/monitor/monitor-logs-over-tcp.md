# Monitor TCP logs with {{% param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

Writing logs over a network using raw TCP is a widely used method for transmitting log data between systems.
It provides a direct, connection-oriented way to send logs from a client, such as an application or logging agent, to a remote server, such as a log aggregator or central logging system.
You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to collect your logs, forward them to a Grafana stack, and create a Grafana dashboard to monitor your system behavior.

The [`alloy-scenarios`][scenarios] repository contains complete working examples of {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} deployments.
Clone the repository and use the example deployments to understand how {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} collects, processes, and exports telemetry signals.

In this example scenario, {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} uses a TCP endpoint to collect logs written by an application as a JSON payload and forwards them to a Loki destination.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the following:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
You need administrator privileges to run `docker` commands.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Clone and deploy the example

Follow these steps to clone the scenarios repository and deploy the monitoring example:

1. Clone the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} scenarios repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/alloy-scenarios.git
   ```

2. Start Docker to deploy the Grafana stack:

   ```shell
   cd alloy-scenarios/logs-tcp
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Check the status of the Docker containers:

   ```shell
   docker ps
   ```

3. (Optional) Stop Docker to shut down the Grafana stack when you finish exploring this example:

   ```shell
   docker compose down
   ```

## Monitor and visualize your data

Use Grafana to monitor your deployment's health and visualize your data.

### Monitor {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

To monitor the health of your {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} deployment, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345).

For more information about the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI, refer to [Debug Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/troubleshoot/debug/).

### Visualize your data

To use the Grafana Logs Drilldown, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app](http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app).

To create a [dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/#create-a-dashboard) to visualize your metrics and logs, open your browser and go to [`http://localhost:3000/dashboards`](http://localhost:3000/dashboards).

## Understand the {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} configuration

This example uses a `config.alloy` file to configure the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} components for logging.
You can find the `config.alloy` file in the cloned repository at `alloy-scenarios/logs-tcp/`.

The configuration includes `livedebugging` to stream real-time data to the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.

### Configure `livedebugging`

`livedebugging` streams real-time data from your components directly to the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.
Refer to the [Troubleshooting documentation][troubleshooting] for more details about this feature.

[troubleshooting]: https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/troubleshoot/debug/#live-debugging-page

#### `livedebugging`

`livedebugging` is disabled by default.
Enable it explicitly through the `livedebugging` configuration block to make debugging data visible in the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI.

```alloy
livedebugging {
  enabled = true
}
```

### Configure logging

The logging configuration in this example requires three components:

* `loki.source.api`
* `loki.process`
* `loki-write`

#### `loki.source.api`

The [`loki.source.api`][loki.source.api] component receives log entries over HTTP and forwards them to other Loki components.
In this example, the component requires the following arguments:

* `listen_address`: The network address the server listens to for new connections. Setting this argument to `0.0.0.0` tells the server to listen on all IP addresses.
* `listen_port`: The port the server listens to for new connections.
* `forward_to`: The list of receivers to send log entries to.

```alloy
loki.source.api "loki_push_api" {
    http {
        listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
        listen_port = 9999
    }
    forward_to = [
        loki.process.lables.receiver,
    ]
}
```

#### `loki.process`

The [`loki.process`][loki.process] component receives log entries from other Loki components, applies one or more processing stages, and forwards the results to the list of receivers.
In this example, the component requires the following arguments:

* `expressions`: Key-value pairs defining the name of the data extracted and the value it's populated with.
* `values`: Key-value pairs defining the label to set and how to look them up.
* `forward_to`: The list of receivers to send log entries to.

```alloy
loki.process "lables" {
    stage.json {
      expressions = { "extracted_service" = "service_name", 
                      "extracted_code_line" = "code_line", 
                      "extracted_server" = "server_id", 
                    }
    }

  stage.labels {
    values = {
      "service_name" = "extracted_service",
    }
  }

  stage.structured_metadata {
    values = {
      "code_line" = "extracted_code_line",
      "server" = "extracted_server",
      }
    }

  forward_to = [loki.write.local.receiver]
}
```

#### `loki-write`

The [`loki.write`][loki.write] component writes the logs to a Loki destination.
In this example, the component requires the following argument:

* `url`: Defines the full URL endpoint in Loki to send logs to.

```alloy
loki.write "local" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```
