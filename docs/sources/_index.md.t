# Overview

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} offers native pipelines for OTel, [Prometheus][], [Pyroscope][], [Loki][], and many other metrics, logs, traces, and profile tools.
In addition, you can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} pipelines to do different tasks, such as configure alert rules in Loki and Mimir.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is fully compatible with the OTel Collector, Prometheus Agent, and Promtail.
You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} as an alternative to either of these solutions or combine it into a hybrid system of multiple collectors and agents.
You can deploy {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} anywhere within your IT infrastructure and pair it with your Grafana LGTM stack, a telemetry backend from Grafana Cloud, or any other compatible backend from any other vendor.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is flexible, and you can easily configure it to fit your needs in on-prem, cloud-only, or a mix of both.

{{< admonition type="tip" >}}
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} uses the same components, code, and concepts that were first introduced in Grafana Agent Flow.

## What can {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} do?

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is more than just observability signals like metrics, logs, and traces. It provides many features that help you quickly find and process your data in complex environments.
Some of these features include:

* **Custom components:** You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to create and share custom components.
  Custom components combine a pipeline of existing components into a single, easy-to-understand component that's just a few lines long.
  You can use pre-built custom components from the community, ones packaged by Grafana, or create your own.
* **GitOps compatibility:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} uses frameworks to pull configurations from Git, S3, HTTP endpoints, and just about any other source.
* **Clustering support:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} has native clustering support.
  Clustering helps distribute the workload and ensures you have high availability.
  You can quickly create horizontally scalable deployments with minimal resource and operational overhead.
* **Security:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} helps you manage authentication credentials and connect to HashiCorp Vault servers or Kubernetes clusters to retrieve Kubernetes secrets.
* **Debugging utilities:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides debugging tools such as an embedded [user interface][UI] to help you identify and resolve configuration problems.
