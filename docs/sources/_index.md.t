# {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is a vendor-neutral, batteries-included telemetry collector with configuration inspired by [Terraform][].
It is designed to be flexible, performant, and compatible with multiple ecosystems such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is based around **components**. Components are wired together to form programmable observability **pipelines** for telemetry collection, processing, and delivery.

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} can collect, transform, and send data to:

* The [Prometheus][] ecosystem
* The [OpenTelemetry][] ecosystem
* The Grafana open source ecosystem ([Loki][], [Grafana][], [Tempo][], [Mimir][], [Pyroscope][])

## Why use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}?

* **Vendor-neutral**: Fully compatible with the Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Grafana open source ecosystems.
* **Every signal**: Collect telemetry data for metrics, logs, traces, and continuous profiles.
* **Scalable**: Deploy on any number of machines to collect millions of active series and terabytes of logs.
* **Battle-tested**: {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} extends the existing battle-tested code from the Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Collector projects.
* **Powerful**: Write programmable pipelines with ease, and debug them using a [built-in UI][UI].
* **Batteries included**: Integrate with systems like MySQL, Kubernetes, and Apache to get telemetry that's immediately useful.
