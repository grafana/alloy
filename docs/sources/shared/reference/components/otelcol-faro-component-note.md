{{< admonition type="note" >}}
This component is particularly useful for [Frontend Observability][frontend-observability] users who want to process telemetry data collected with the Grafana Faro Web SDK before sending it to Grafana Cloud. This approach gives you full control over your data processing pipeline, allowing you to remove sensitive information, filter out specific signals, and apply custom processing rules.
