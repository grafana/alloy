# Generate a support bundle

A support bundle is a compressed file that contains information about a running {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} instance.
Use it as a baseline when you debug an [issue][alloy-repo].

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Support bundles require {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} v1.5 or later.
{{< /admonition >}}

The [backward-compatibility][backward-compatibility] guarantees don't cover this feature.

## Generate the bundle

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} exposes the `/-/support` endpoint on its HTTP server listen address, which defaults to `localhost:12345`.

To generate a support bundle, send a request to the endpoint:

```bash
curl -o support.zip http://localhost:12345/-/support
```

You can specify an optional `duration` parameter to control how long the bundle collection runs.
If you don't provide it, the duration defaults to the configured HTTP server write timeout.
The value must be less than or equal to the write timeout.

```bash
curl -o support.zip "http://localhost:12345/-/support?duration=30s"
```

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The endpoint is enabled by default.
To disable it, use the `--disable-support-bundle` runtime flag.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Inspect the bundle

The support bundle contains all information in plain text.
Inspect it before you share it to verify that no sensitive information has leaked.

You can also inspect the [support bundle implementation](https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/main/internal/service/http/supportbundle.go) to verify the code that generates these bundles.

## Bundle contents

A support bundle contains the following data:

* `alloy-components.json`: Information about the [components][components] running on this {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} instance, generated by the `/api/v0/web/components` endpoint.
* `alloy-environment.txt`: Values of several environment variables relevant to the Go runtime.
* `alloy-logs.txt`: Logs captured during bundle generation.
* `alloy-metadata.yaml`: {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} build version and the installation's operating system, architecture, and uptime.
* `alloy-metrics-sample-start.txt`: A snapshot of internal metrics at the start of bundle collection.
* `alloy-metrics-sample-end.txt`: A snapshot of internal metrics at the end of bundle collection.
* `alloy-peers.json`: Information about cluster peers of this {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} instance, generated by the `/api/v0/web/peers` endpoint.
* `alloy-runtime-flags.txt`: Values of the runtime flags available in {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.
* `pprof/`: Go runtime profiling data (CPU, heap, goroutine, mutex, block profiles) as exported by the pprof package.
  Refer to [Profile resource consumption][profile] for more information.
* `sources/`: Copies of the local configuration files used to configure {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.
* `sources/remote-config/remote.alloy`: A copy of the last received [remote configuration][remotecfg].
