# Debug {{% param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

Follow these steps to debug issues with {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}:

1. Use the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI to debug issues.
1. If the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI doesn't help with debugging an issue, you can examine the logs.

## {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} UI

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes an embedded UI viewable from the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} HTTP server, which defaults to listening at `http://localhost:12345`.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
For security reasons, installations of {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} on non-containerized platforms default to listening on `localhost`.
This default prevents other machines on the network from being able to view the UI.

To expose the UI to other machines on the network on non-containerized platforms, refer to the documentation for how you [installed][install] {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.

If you are running a custom installation of {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}, refer to the documentation for the [`run`][run] command to learn how to change the HTTP listen address and pass the appropriate flag when running {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.

### Home page

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alloy/ui_home_page.png" alt="Alloy UI home page" >}}

The home page shows a table of components defined in the configuration file and their health.

Click **View** on a row in the table to navigate to the [Component detail page](#component-detail-page) for that component.

Click the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} logo to navigate back to the home page.

### Graph page

{{< docs/shared lookup="stability/experimental_feature.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alloy/ui_graph_page_new_2.png" alt="Alloy UI graph page" >}}

The **Graph** page shows a graph view of components defined in the configuration file.
Clicking a component in the graph navigates to the [Component detail page](#component-detail-page) for that component.

You can click and drag the components to move them around.

To access the graph page of a module, click on the **Graph** button on the module's detail page.

The amount of data that exits a component that supports [live debugging](#live-debugging-page) appears on the outgoing edges of the component.
The data refreshes according to the `window` parameter.

### Component detail page

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alloy/ui_component_detail_page_2.png" alt="Alloy UI component detail page" >}}

The component detail page shows the following information for each component:

* The health of the component with a message explaining the health.
* The current evaluated arguments for the component.
* The current exports for the component.
* The current debug info for the component if the component has debug info.

From there you can also go to the component documentation or to its corresponding [Live Debugging page](#live-debugging-page).

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Values marked as a [secret][] display only as the text `(secret)`.

[secret]: ../../get-started/configuration-syntax/expressions/types_and_values/#secrets
{{< /admonition >}}

### Clustering page

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alloy/ui_clustering_page.png" alt="Alloy UI clustering page" >}}

The clustering page shows the following information for each cluster node:

* The node's name.
* The node's advertised address.
* The node's current state, Viewer, Participant, or Terminating.
* The local node that serves the UI.

### Live Debugging page

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alloy/ui_live_debugging_page.png" alt="Alloy UI live debugging page" >}}

Live debugging provides a real-time stream of debugging data from a component. You can access this page from the corresponding [Component detail page](#component-detail-page).

{{< admonition type="caution" >}}
Live debugging defaults to disabled to avoid accidentally displaying sensitive telemetry data. To enable live debugging, configure the [`livedebugging`][livedebugging] block.

[livedebugging]: ../../reference/config-blocks/livedebugging/
{{< /admonition >}}

Live debugging allows you to do the following:

* Pause and clear the data stream.
* Sample data and disable auto-scrolling to handle heavy loads.
* Search through the data using keywords.
* Copy the entire data stream to the clipboard.

The format and content of the debugging data vary depending on the component type.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Live debugging isn't yet available in all components.

Supported components:

* `loki.process`
* `loki.relabel`
* `loki.secretfilter`
* `otelcol.connector.*`
* `otelcol.processor.*`
* `otelcol.receiver.*`
* `prometheus.remote_write`
* `prometheus.relabel`
* `discovery.*`
* `prometheus.scrape`
{{< /admonition >}}

## Debug using the UI

To debug using the UI:

* Ensure that no component reports as unhealthy.
* Ensure that the arguments and exports for misbehaving components appear correct.
* Ensure that the live debugging data meets your expectations.

## Examine logs

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides different log levels that help you determine the root cause of issues.
You can configure the log level using the [`logging`][logging] configuration block in your {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} configuration file.

Logs from {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} are written in `logfmt` format by default.
You can configure the [log format][] to be either `logfmt` or `json`.
You can [retrieve][] the logs in different ways depending on your platform and installation method.

[logging]: ../../reference/config-blocks/logging/
[log format]: ../../reference/config-blocks/logging/#log-format
[retrieve]: ../../reference/config-blocks/logging/#retrieve-logs

### Common log messages

The following log messages are normal during {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} operation:

#### Component lifecycle messages

During normal startup and operation, you'll see messages about component lifecycle:

**Component startup and initialization:**

```text
level=info msg="starting controller"
level=info msg="starting server"
level=info msg="starting server" addr=localhost:8080
level=info msg="started scheduled components"
```

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The `starting server` messages refer to the built-in [HTTP server][http] that hosts the debugging UI, `/metrics` endpoint, and other debugging endpoints.

[http]: ../../reference/config-blocks/http/
{{< /admonition >}}

**Component updates and configuration changes:**

```text
level=info msg="configuration loaded"
level=info msg="module content loaded"
level=info msg="started scheduled components"
level=info msg="terminating server"
```

**Component health reporting:**

```text
level=info msg="started scheduled components"
level=warn msg="failed to start scheduled component" err="connection refused"
level=warn msg="the discovery.process component only works on linux; enabling it otherwise will do nothing"
```

#### Cluster operation messages

If you enable clustering, you'll see messages about cluster operations:

**Normal startup and peer discovery:**

```text
level=info msg="starting cluster node" peers_count=2 peers=192.168.1.10:12345,192.168.1.11:12345 advertise_addr=192.168.1.12:12345
level=info msg="using provided peers for discovery" join_peers="192.168.1.10:12345, 192.168.1.11:12345"
level=info msg="discovered peers" peers_count=3 peers=192.168.1.10:12345,192.168.1.11:12345,192.168.1.12:12345
level=info msg="rejoining peers" peers_count=2 peers=192.168.1.10:12345,192.168.1.11:12345
```

**Cluster size management:**

```text
level=info msg="minimum cluster size reached, marking cluster as ready to admit traffic" minimum_cluster_size=3 peers_count=3
level=warn msg="minimum cluster size requirements are not met - marking cluster as not ready for traffic" minimum_cluster_size=3 minimum_size_wait_timeout=5m0s peers_count=2
level=warn msg="deadline passed, marking cluster as ready to admit traffic" minimum_cluster_size=3 minimum_size_wait_timeout=5m0s peers_count=2
```

**Normal cluster operations:**

```text
level=debug msg="found an IP cluster join address" addr=192.168.1.10:12345
level=debug msg="received DNS query response" addr=cluster.example.com record_type=A records_count=3
```

#### Expected warnings

Some warnings are normal during startup or cluster changes:

```text
level=warn msg="failed to get peers to join at startup; will create a new cluster" err="no peers available"
level=warn msg="failed to connect to peers; bootstrapping a new cluster" err="connection refused"
level=warn msg="failed to resolve provided join address" addr=unavailable-node:12345
```

#### Problematic messages

These messages indicate issues that require attention:

```text
level=error msg="failed to bootstrap a fresh cluster with no peers" err="bind: address already in use"
level=error msg="failed to rejoin list of peers" err="connection timeout"
level=warn msg="failed to refresh list of peers" err="dns resolution failed"
```

## Debug clustering issues

To debug issues when using [clustering][], check for the following symptoms.

* **Cluster not converging**: The cluster peers aren't converging on the same view of their peers' status.
  This is most likely due to network connectivity issues between the cluster nodes.
  Use the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} UI of each running peer to understand which nodes aren't picked up correctly.
* **Cluster split brain**: The cluster peers aren't aware of one another, thinking they're the only node present.
  Again, check for network connectivity issues.
  Check that the addresses or DNS names given to the node to join are correctly formatted and reachable.
* **Configuration drift**: Clustering assumes that all nodes are running with the same configuration file at roughly the same time.
  Check the logs for issues with the reloaded configuration file as well as the graph page to verify that the changes are applied.
* **Node name conflicts**: Clustering assumes all nodes have unique names.
  The cluster rejects nodes with conflicting names and they won't join the cluster.
  Look at the clustering UI page for the list of current peers with their names, and check the logs for any reported name conflict events.
* **Node stuck in terminating state**: The node attempted to gracefully shut down and set its state to Terminating, but it hasn't completely gone away.
  Check the clustering page to view the state of the peers and verify that the terminating {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} has been shut down.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Some issues that appear to be clustering issues may be symptoms of other issues, for example, problems with scraping or service discovery can result in missing metrics for an {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} instance that you can interpret as a node not joining the cluster.
