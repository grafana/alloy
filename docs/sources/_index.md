# Overview

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} offers native pipelines for [OTel][], [Prometheus][], [Pyroscope][], [Loki][], and many other metrics, logs, traces, and profile tools.
In addition, you can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} pipelines to do different tasks, such as configure alert rules in Loki and [Mimir][].
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is fully compatible with the OTel Collector, Prometheus Agent, and [Promtail][].
You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} as an alternative to either of these solutions or combine it into a hybrid system of multiple collectors and agents.
You can deploy {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} anywhere within your IT infrastructure and pair it with your Grafana LGTM stack, a telemetry backend from Grafana Cloud, or any other compatible backend from any other vendor.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is flexible, and you can easily configure it to fit your needs in on-prem, cloud-only, or a mix of both.

{{< admonition type="tip" >}}
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} uses the same components, code, and concepts that were first introduced in Grafana Agent Flow.
{{< /admonition >}}

## What can {{% param "PRODUCT_NAME" %}} do?

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is more than just observability signals like metrics, logs, and traces. It provides many features that help you quickly find and process your data in complex environments.
Some of these features include custom components, GitOps compatibility, clustering support, security, and debugging utilities. Refer to the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} [Introduction] for more information on these and other key features.
