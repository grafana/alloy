# Community components

__Community components__ are [components][Components] implemented and maintained by the community.

While Grafana does not offer commercial support for these components, they undergo acceptance and review by {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}'s team before being added to the repository.

To use these community components, you need to explicitly pass the `--community-component` flag to the `run` command.

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
__Community components__ that are not kept up to date by the community may be disable or removed.
