[Changelog]: https://github.com/grafana/alloy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## v1.5

### Breaking change: Change default value of `max_streams` in `otelcol.processor.deltatocumulative`

The default value was changed from `0` to `9223372036854775807` (max int).

### Breaking change: Change default value of `namespace` in `otelcol.connector.spanmetrics`

The default value was changed from `""` to `"traces.span.metrics"`.

### Breaking change: The component `otelcol.exporter.logging` has been removed in favor of `otelcol.exporter.debug`

Both components are very similar. More information can be found in the [announcement issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/11337).

### Breaking change: Change default value of `revision` in `import.git`

The default value was changed from `"HEAD"` to `"main"`.
Setting the `revision` to `"HEAD"`, `"FETCH_HEAD"`, `"ORIG_HEAD"`, `"MERGE_HEAD"` or `"CHERRY_PICK_HEAD"` is no longer allowed.

## v1.4

### Breaking change: Some debug metrics for `otelcol` components have changed

For example, `otelcol.exporter.otlp`'s `exporter_sent_spans_ratio_total` metric is now `otelcol_exporter_sent_spans_total`.
You may need to change your dashboard and alert settings to reference the new metrics.
Refer to each component's documentation page for more information.

### Breaking change: The `convert_sum_to_gauge` and `convert_gauge_to_sum` functions in `otelcol.processor.transform` change context

The `convert_sum_to_gauge` and `convert_gauge_to_sum` functions must now be used in the `metric` context rather than in the `datapoint` context.
This is due to a [change upstream](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/34567).

### Breaking change: Renamed metrics in `beyla.ebpf`

`process.cpu.state` is renamed to `cpu.mode` and `beyla_build_info` is renamed to `beyla_internal_build_info`.

## v1.3

### Breaking change: `remotecfg` block updated argument name from `metadata` to `attributes`

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

[backward compatibility]: ../introduction/backward-compatibility/
{{< /admonition >}}

The `remotecfg` block has an updated argument name from `metadata` to `attributes`.

## v1.2

### Breaking change: `remotecfg` block updated for Agent rename

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
This feature is in [Public preview][] and is not covered by {{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}} [backward compatibility][] guarantees.

[Public preview]: https://grafana.com/docs/release-life-cycle/
[backward compatibility]: ../introduction/backward-compatibility/
{{< /admonition >}}

The `remotecfg` block has been updated to use [alloy-remote-config](https://github.com/grafana/alloy-remote-config)
over [agent-remote-config](https://github.com/grafana/agent-remote-config). This change
aligns `remotecfg` API terminology with Alloy and includes updated endpoints.
