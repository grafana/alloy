### Breaking change: `remotecfg` block updated for Agent rename

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
This feature is in [Public preview][] and is not covered by {{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}} [backward compatibility][] guarantees.

{{< /admonition >}}

The `remotecfg` block has been updated to use [alloy-remote-config](https://github.com/grafana/alloy-remote-config)
over [agent-remote-config](https://github.com/grafana/agent-remote-config). This change
aligns `remotecfg` API terminology with Alloy and includes updated endpoints.
