# `prometheus.exporter.ssh`

{{< docs/shared lookup="stability/experimental.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

The `prometheus.exporter.ssh` component embeds an SSH exporter for collecting metrics from remote servers over SSH and exporting them as Prometheus metrics.

## Usage

```alloy
prometheus.exporter.ssh "example" {
  targets {
    address         = "192.168.1.10"
    username        = "admin"
    key_file     = "path/to/key.pem"
    custom_metrics {
      name    = "load_average"
      command = "cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1}'"
      type    = "gauge"
      help    = "Load average over 1 minute"
      labels  = { host = "192.168.1.10" }  // attach host as a label
    }
  }
}

# Arguments

The `prometheus.exporter.ssh` component doesn't support any arguments. You can configure this component with blocks.

## Blocks

You can use the following blocks with `prometheus.exporter.ssh`:

| Block                                          | Description                                     | Required |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [`targets`][targets]                           | Configures SSH targets to collect metrics from. | yes      |
| `targets` > [`custom_metrics`][custom_metrics] | Defines metrics to collect from a server.       | yes      |

The `>` symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting.
For example, `targets` > `custom_metrics` refers to a `custom_metrics` block defined inside a `target` block.

[targets]: #targets
[custom_metrics]: #custom_metrics

### `targets`

<span class="badge docs-labels__stage docs-labels__item">Required</span>

Configures SSH targets to collect metrics from.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name              | Type       | Description                                        | Default | Required |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `address`         | `string`   | The IP or hostname of the target server.           |         | yes      |
| `username`        | `string`   | SSH username.                                      |         | yes      |
| `command_timeout` | `duration` | Timeout for each SSH command.                      | `"30s"` | no       |
| `key_file`        | `string`   | Private key file path for key-based authorization. |         | no       |
| `password`        | `secret`   | Password for SSH login.                            |         | no       |
| `port`            | `int`      | SSH port number.                                   | `22`    | no       |

Either `password` or `key_file` must be set. If both are provided, `key_file` is used.

### `custom_metrics`

Defines metrics to collect from a server.

<span class="badge docs-labels__stage docs-labels__item">Required</span>


The following arguments are supported:

You can attach arbitrary labels to your metrics using the `labels` argument in `custom_metrics` (for example, `labels = { address = each.value }`).

| Name          | Type                  | Description                                              | Default | Required |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `command`     | `string`              | Command to run remotely to get the metric value.         |         | yes      |
| `name`        | `string`              | Name of the exported metric.                             |         | yes      |
| `type`        | `string`              | Metric type: `gauge` or `counter`.                       |         | yes      |
| `help`        | `string`              | Help text for the metric.                                |         | no       |
| `labels`      | `map(string, string)` | Additional labels to attach to the metric.               | `{}`    | no       |
| `parse_regex` | `string`              | Regular expression to extract value from command output. |         | no       |

## Secure known hosts setup

### How It Works

1. **First Run**: If `~/.ssh/known_hosts` is missing, a new one is created using `ssh-keyscan`.
2. **Validation**: Host keys are validated on every connection attempt.
3. **Changes**: Key mismatches raise an error requiring manual review.
4. **New Targets**: Automatically scanned and added, but mismatches block the connection.

### Manual resolution

Use `ssh-keyscan` or another secure method to update `known_hosts` when a host key legitimately changes.

## Security considerations

- Only valid IPs/hostnames accepted.
- Backticks and semicolons are disallowed in commands to prevent injection.
- SSH key files must be `0600`.
- Known-hosts entries are bootstrapped and never overwritten.
- On Windows, host-key checks are skipped.

## Exported fields

{{< docs/shared lookup="reference/components/exporter-component-exports.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

## Component health

`prometheus.exporter.ssh` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid configuration.
In those cases, exported fields retain their last healthy values.

## Debug information

`prometheus.exporter.ssh` doesn't expose any component-specific debug information.

## Debug metrics

`prometheus.exporter.ssh` doesn't expose any component-specific debug metrics.

## Examples

```alloy
// Discover SSH key files matching hosts
local.file_match "ssh_keys" {
  path_targets = [{ "__path__" = "/path/to/keys/*.pem" }]
}
prometheus.exporter.ssh "example" {
  targets {
    address         = "192.168.1.10"
    port            = 22
    username        = "admin"
    password        = "password"
    command_timeout = "10s"

    custom_metrics {
      name    = "load_average"
      command = "cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1}'"
      type    = "gauge"
      help    = "Load average over 1 minute"
      labels  = { host = "192.168.1.10" }  // attach host as a label
    }
  }

  targets {
    address         = "192.168.1.11"
    port            = 22
    username        = "monitor"
    key_file        = "/path/to/private.key"
    command_timeout = "15s"

    custom_metrics {
      name        = "disk_usage"
      command     = "df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'"
      type        = "gauge"
      help        = "Disk usage percentage"
      parse_regex = "(\d+)%"
      labels      = { host = "192.168.1.11" }  // attach host as a label
    }
  }
}

prometheus.scrape "demo" {
  targets    = prometheus.exporter.ssh.example.targets
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.demo.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "demo" {
  endpoint {
    url = <PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>

    basic_auth {
      username = <USERNAME>
      password = <PASSWORD>
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the following:

* _`<PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>`_: Remote write-compatible server URL.
* _`<USERNAME>`_: Auth username.
* _`<PASSWORD>`_: Auth password.
