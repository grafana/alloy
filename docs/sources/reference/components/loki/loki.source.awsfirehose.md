# `loki.source.awsfirehose`

`loki.source.awsfirehose` receives log entries over HTTP from [Amazon Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html) and forwards them to other `loki.*` components.

The HTTP API exposed is compatible
with the [Data Firehose HTTP Delivery API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html).
Since the API model that Data Firehose uses to deliver data over HTTP is generic enough, the same component can be used to receive data from multiple origins:

* [Amazon CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/writing-with-cloudwatch-logs.html)
* [Amazon CloudWatch events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/writing-with-cloudwatch-events.html)
* Custom data through [DirectPUT requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/writing-with-sdk.html)

The component uses a heuristic to try to decode as much information as possible from each log record, and it falls back to writing the raw records to Loki.
The decoding process goes as follows:

* Data Firehose sends batched requests
* Each record is treated individually
* For each `record` received in each request:
  * If the `record` comes from a [CloudWatch logs subscription filter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/SubscriptionFilters.html#DestinationKinesisExample), it's decoded and each logging event is written to Loki
  * All other records are written raw to Loki

The component exposes some internal labels, available for relabeling.
The following tables describes internal labels available in records coming from any source.

| Name                        | Description                        | Example                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `__aws_firehose_request_id` | Data Firehose request ID.          | `a1af4300-6c09-4916-ba8f-12f336176246`                                   |
| `__aws_firehose_source_arn` | Data Firehose delivery stream ARN. | `arn:aws:firehose:us-east-2:123:deliverystream/aws_firehose_test_stream` |

If the source of the Data Firehose record is CloudWatch logs, the request is further decoded and enriched with even more labels, exposed as follows:

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `__aws_cw_log_group`       | The log group name of the originating log data.                                                                                                                                                       | `CloudTrail/logs`                        |
| `__aws_cw_log_stream`      | The log stream name of the originating log data.                                                                                                                                                      | `111111111111_CloudTrail/logs_us-east-1` |
| `__aws_cw_matched_filters` | The list of subscription filter names that match the originating log data. The list is encoded as a comma-separated list.                                                                             | `Destination,Destination2`               |
| `__aws_cw_msg_type`        | Data messages use the `DATA_MESSAGE` type. Sometimes CloudWatch Logs may emit Amazon Kinesis Data Streams records with a `CONTROL_MESSAGE` type, mainly for checking if the destination is reachable. | `DATA_MESSAGE`                           |
| `__aws_owner`              | The AWS Account ID of the originating log data.                                                                                                                                                       | `111111111111`                           |

Refer to the [Examples](#example) for a full example configuration showing how to enrich each log entry with these labels.

## Usage

```alloy
loki.source.awsfirehose "<LABEL>" {
    http {
        listen_address = "<LISTEN_ADDRESS>"
        listen_port = "<PORT>"
    }
    forward_to = RECEIVER_LIST
}
```

The component starts an HTTP server on the configured port and address with the following endpoints:

* `/awsfirehose/api/v1/push` - accepting `POST` requests compatible with [Data Firehose HTTP Specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html).

You can use the [X-Amz-Firehose-Common-Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html) header to set extra static labels.
You can configure the header in the **Parameters** section of the Data Firehose delivery stream configuration.
Label names must be prefixed with `lbl_`.
The prefix is removed before the label is stored in the log entry.
Label names and label values must be compatible with the [Prometheus data model](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels) specification.

Example of the valid `X-Amz-Firehose-Common-Attributes` value with two custom labels:

```json
{
  "commonAttributes": {
    "lbl_label1": "value1",
    "lbl_label2": "value2"
  }
}
```

## Arguments

You can use the following arguments with `loki.source.awsfirehose`:

| Name                     | Type                 | Description                                                    | Default | Required |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `forward_to`             | `list(LogsReceiver)` | List of receivers to send log entries to.                      |         | yes      |
| `access_key`             | `secret`             | If set, require Data Firehose to provide a matching key.       | `""`    | no       |
| `relabel_rules`          | `RelabelRules`       | Relabeling rules to apply on log entries.                      | `{}`    | no       |
| `use_incoming_timestamp` | `bool`               | Whether or not to use the timestamp received from the request. | `false` | no       |

The `relabel_rules` field can make use of the `rules` export value from a [`loki.relabel`][loki.relabel] component to apply one or more relabeling rules to log entries before they're forwarded to the list of receivers in `forward_to`.

## Debug metrics

The following are some of the metrics that are exposed when this component is used.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The metrics include labels  such as `status_code` where relevant, which you can use to measure request success rates.
{{< /admonition >}}

* `loki_source_awsfirehose_batch_size` (histogram): Size (in units) of the number of records received per request.
* `loki_source_awsfirehose_invalid_static_labels_errors` (counter): Count number of errors while processing Data Firehose static labels.
* `loki_source_awsfirehose_record_errors` (counter): Count of errors while decoding an individual record.
* `loki_source_awsfirehose_records_received` (counter): Count of records received.
* `loki_source_awsfirehose_request_errors` (counter): Count of errors while receiving a request.

## Example

This example starts an HTTP server on `0.0.0.0` address and port `9999`.
The server receives log entries and forwards them to a `loki.write` component.
The `loki.write` component sends the logs to the specified Loki instance using basic auth credentials provided.

```alloy
loki.write "local" {
    endpoint {
        url = "http://loki:3100/api/v1/push"
        basic_auth {
            username = "<USERNAME>"
            password_file = "<PASSWORD_FILE>"
        }
    }
}

loki.source.awsfirehose "loki_fh_receiver" {
    http {
        listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
        listen_port = 9999
    }
    forward_to = [
        loki.write.local.receiver,
    ]
}
```

Replace the following:

* _`<USERNAME>`_: Your username.
* _`<PASSWORD_FILE>`_: Your password file.

As another example, if you are receiving records that originated from a CloudWatch logs subscription, you can enrich each received entry by relabeling internal labels.
The following configuration builds upon the one above but keeps the origin log stream and group as `log_stream` and `log_group`, respectively.

```alloy
loki.write "local" {
    endpoint {
        url = "http://loki:3100/api/v1/push"
        basic_auth {
            username = "<USERNAME>"
            password_file = "<PASSWORD_FILE>"
        }
    }
}

loki.source.awsfirehose "loki_fh_receiver" {
    http {
        listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
        listen_port = 9999
    }
    forward_to = [
        loki.write.local.receiver,
    ]
    relabel_rules = loki.relabel.logging_origin.rules
}

loki.relabel "logging_origin" {
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__aws_cw_log_group"]
    target_label = "log_group"
  }
  rule {
    action = "replace"
    source_labels = ["__aws_cw_log_stream"]
    target_label = "log_stream"
  }
  forward_to = []
}
```

Replace the following:

* _`<USERNAME>`_: Your username.
* _`<PASSWORD_FILE>`_: Your password file.
