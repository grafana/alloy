# `otelcol.receiver.kafka`

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` accepts telemetry data from a Kafka broker and forwards it to other `otelcol.*` components.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
`otelcol.receiver.kafka` is a wrapper over the upstream OpenTelemetry Collector [`kafka`][] receiver.
Bug reports or feature requests will be redirected to the upstream repository, if necessary.

[`kafka`]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/{{< param "OTEL_VERSION" >}}/receiver/kafkareceiver
{{< /admonition >}}

You can specify multiple `otelcol.receiver.kafka` components by giving them different labels.

## Usage

```alloy
otelcol.receiver.kafka "<LABEL>" {
  brokers          = ["<BROKER_ADDR>"]
  protocol_version = "<PROTOCOL_VERSION>"

  output {
    metrics = [...]
    logs    = [...]
    traces  = [...]
  }
}
```

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
The `topic` and `encoding` arguments are deprecated in favor of the [`logs`][logs], [`metrics`][metrics], and [`traces`][traces] blocks.
{{< /admonition >}}

For `max_fetch_size`, the value `0` means no limit.

`initial_offset` must be either `"latest"` or `"earliest"`.

The `group_rebalance_strategy` argument determines how Kafka distributes topic partitions among the consumers in the group during rebalances. 
Supported strategies are:

- `range`: This strategy assigns partitions to consumers based on a range. 
  It aims to distribute partitions evenly across consumers, but it can lead to uneven distribution if the number of partitions is not a multiple of the number of consumers. 
  For more information, refer to the Kafka RangeAssignor documentation, see [RangeAssignor][].
- `roundrobin`: This strategy assigns partitions to consumers in a round-robin fashion. 
  It ensures a more even distribution of partitions across consumers, especially when the number of partitions is not a multiple of the number of consumers. 
  For more information, refer to the Kafka RoundRobinAssignor documentation, see [RoundRobinAssignor][].
- `sticky`: This strategy aims to maintain the same partition assignments during rebalances as much as possible. 
  It minimizes the number of partition movements, which can be beneficial for stateful consumers. 
  For more information, refer to the Kafka StickyAssignor documentation, see [StickyAssignor][].

Using a `group_instance_id` is useful for stateful consumers or when you need to ensure that a specific consumer instance is always assigned the same set of partitions.

- If `group_instance_id` is set to a non-empty string, the consumer is treated as a static member of the group. 
  This means that the consumer will maintain its partition assignments across restarts and rebalances, as long as it rejoins the group with the same `group_instance_id`.
- If `group_instance_id` is set to an empty string (or not set), the consumer is treated as a dynamic member. 
  In this case, the consumer's partition assignments may change during rebalances.

### `debug_metrics`

{{< docs/shared lookup="reference/components/otelcol-debug-metrics-block.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

### `error_backoff`

The `error_backoff` block configures how failed requests to Kafka are retried.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                   | Type       | Description                                            | Default | Required |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `enabled`              | `boolean`  | Enables retrying failed requests.                      | `false` | no       |
| `initial_interval`     | `duration` | Initial time to wait before retrying a failed request. | `"0s"`  | no       |
| `max_elapsed_time`     | `duration` | Maximum time to wait before discarding a failed batch. | `"0s"`  | no       |
| `max_interval`         | `duration` | Maximum time to wait between retries.                  | `"0s"`  | no       |
| `multiplier`           | `number`   | Factor to grow wait time before retrying.              | `0`     | no       |
| `randomization_factor` | `number`   | Factor to randomize wait time before retrying.         | `0`     | no       |

When `enabled` is `true`, failed batches are retried after a given interval.
The `initial_interval` argument specifies how long to wait before the first retry attempt.
If requests continue to fail, the time to wait before retrying increases by the factor specified by the `multiplier` argument, which must be greater than `1.0`.
The `max_interval` argument specifies the upper bound of how long to wait between retries.

The `randomization_factor` argument is useful for adding jitter between retrying Alloy instances.
If `randomization_factor` is greater than `0`, the wait time before retries is multiplied by a random factor in the range `[ I - randomization_factor * I, I + randomization_factor * I]`, where `I` is the current interval.

If a batch hasn't been sent successfully, it's discarded after the time specified by `max_elapsed_time` elapses.
If `max_elapsed_time` is set to `"0s"`, failed requests are retried forever until they succeed.

### `header_extraction`

The `header_extraction` block configures how to extract headers from Kafka records.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name              | Type           | Description                                             | Default | Required |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `extract_headers` | `bool`         | Enables attaching header fields to resource attributes. | `false` | no       |
| `headers`         | `list(string)` | A list of headers to extract from the Kafka record.     | `[]`    | no       |

Regular expressions aren't allowed in the `headers` argument.
Only exact matching will be performed.

### `message_marking`

The `message_marking` block configures when Kafka messages are marked as read.

The following arguments are supported:

| Name                   | Type   | Description                                                        | Default | Required |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `after_execution`      | `bool` | Mark messages after forwarding telemetry data to other components. | `false` | no       |
| `include_unsuccessful` | `bool` | Whether failed forwards should be marked as read.                  | `false` | no       |

By default, a Kafka message is marked as read immediately after it's retrieved from the Kafka broker.
If the `after_execution` argument is true, messages are only read after the telemetry data is forwarded to components specified in [the `output` block][output].

When `after_execution` is true, messages are only marked as read when they're decoded successfully and components where the data was forwarded didn't return an error.
If the `include_unsuccessful` argument is true, messages are marked as read even if decoding or forwarding failed.
Setting `include_unsuccessful` has no effect if `after_execution` is `false`.

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
Setting `after_execution` to `true` and `include_unsuccessful` to `false` can block the entire Kafka partition if message processing returns a permanent error, such as failing to decode.

## Exported fields

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` doesn't export any fields.

## Supported encodings

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` supports encoding extensions, as well as the following built-in encodings.

Available for all signals:

- `otlp_proto`: the payload is decoded as OTLP Protobuf
- `otlp_json`: the payload is decoded as OTLP JSON

Available only for traces:

- `jaeger_proto`: the payload is deserialized to a single Jaeger proto `Span`.
- `jaeger_json`: the payload is deserialized to a single Jaeger JSON Span using `jsonpb`.
- `zipkin_proto`: the payload is deserialized into a list of Zipkin proto spans.
- `zipkin_json`: the payload is deserialized into a list of Zipkin V2 JSON spans.
- `zipkin_thrift`: the payload is deserialized into a list of Zipkin Thrift spans.

Available only for logs:

- `raw`: the payload's bytes are inserted as the body of a log record.
- `text`: the payload are decoded as text and inserted as the body of a log record. By default, it uses UTF-8 to decode. You can use `text_<ENCODING>`, like `text_utf-8`, `text_shift_jis`, etc., to customize this behavior.
- `json`: the payload is decoded as JSON and inserted as the body of a log record.
- `azure_resource_logs`: the payload is converted from Azure Resource Logs format to OTel format.

## Message header propagation

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` will extract Kafka message headers and include them as request metadata (context).
This metadata can then be used throughout the pipeline, for example to set attributes using `otelcol.processor.attributes`.

## Component health

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` is only reported as unhealthy if given an invalid
configuration.

## Debug information

`otelcol.receiver.kafka` doesn't expose any component-specific debug information.

## Example

This example forwards read telemetry data through a batch processor before finally sending it to an OTLP-capable endpoint:

```alloy
otelcol.receiver.kafka "default" {
  brokers          = ["localhost:9092"]
  protocol_version = "2.0.0"

  output {
    metrics = [otelcol.processor.batch.default.input]
    logs    = [otelcol.processor.batch.default.input]
    traces  = [otelcol.processor.batch.default.input]
  }
}

otelcol.processor.batch "default" {
  output {
    metrics = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.default.input]
    logs    = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.default.input]
    traces  = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.default.input]
  }
}

otelcol.exporter.otlp "default" {
  client {
    endpoint = sys.env("OTLP_ENDPOINT")
  }
}
```
