# `discovery.puppetdb`

`discovery.puppetdb` allows you to retrieve scrape targets from [PuppetDB](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/7/overview.html) resources.

This SD discovers resources and creates a target for each resource returned by the API.

The resource address is the `certname` of the resource, and can be changed during relabeling.

The queries for this component are expected to be valid [PQL (Puppet Query Language)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/query/v4/pql.html).

## Usage

```alloy
discovery.puppetdb "<LABEL>" {
  url = "<PUPPET_SERVER>"
}
```

## Arguments

You can use the following arguments with `discovery.puppetdb`:

## Blocks

You can use the following blocks with `discovery.puppetdb`:

| Block                                 | Description                                                | Required |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [`authorization`][authorization]      | Configure generic authorization to the endpoint.           | no       |
| [`basic_auth`][basic_auth]            | Configure `basic_auth` for authenticating to the endpoint. | no       |
| [`oauth2`][oauth2]                    | Configure OAuth 2.0 for authenticating to the endpoint.    | no       |
| `oauth2` > [`tls_config`][tls_config] | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint.     | no       |
| [`tls_config`][tls_config]            | Configure TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint.     | no       |

The > symbol indicates deeper levels of nesting.
For example, `oauth2` > `tls_config` refers to a `tls_config` block defined inside an `oauth2` block.

[authorization]: #authorization
[basic_auth]: #basic_auth
[oauth2]: #oauth2
[tls_config]: #tls_config

### `authorization`

The `authorization` block configures generic authorization to the endpoint.

{{< docs/shared lookup="reference/components/authorization-block.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

### `basic_auth`

The `basic_auth` block configures basic authentication to the endpoint.

{{< docs/shared lookup="reference/components/basic-auth-block.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

### `oauth2`

The `oauth` block configures OAuth 2.0 authentication to the endpoint.

{{< docs/shared lookup="reference/components/oauth2-block.md" source="alloy" version="<ALLOY_VERSION>" >}}

### `tls_config`

The `tls_config` block configures TLS settings for connecting to the endpoint.

## Exported fields

The following fields are exported and can be referenced by other components:

| Name      | Type                | Description                                  |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `targets` | `list(map(string))` | The set of targets discovered from PuppetDB. |

Each target includes the following labels:

* `__meta_puppetdb_certname`: The name of the node associated with the resource.
* `__meta_puppetdb_environment`: The environment of the node associated with the resource.
* `__meta_puppetdb_exported`: Whether the resource is exported, either `true` or `false`.
* `__meta_puppetdb_file`: The manifest file in which the resource was declared.
* `__meta_puppetdb_parameter_<parametername>`: The parameters of the resource.
* `__meta_puppetdb_query`: The Puppet Query Language (PQL) query.
* `__meta_puppetdb_resource`: A SHA-1 hash of the resource's type, title, and parameters, for identification.
* `__meta_puppetdb_tags`: A comma separated list of resource tags.
* `__meta_puppetdb_title`: The resource title.
* `__meta_puppetdb_type`: The resource type.

## Component health

`discovery.puppetdb` is only reported as unhealthy when given an invalid configuration.
In those cases, exported fields retain their last healthy values.

## Debug information

`discovery.puppetdb` doesn't expose any component-specific debug information.

## Debug metrics

`discovery.puppetdb` doesn't expose any component-specific debug metrics.

## Example

This example discovers targets from PuppetDB for all the servers that have a specific package defined:

```alloy
discovery.puppetdb "example" {
    url   = "http://puppetdb.local:8080"
    query = "resources { type = \"Package\" and title = \"node_exporter\" }"
    port  = 9100
}

prometheus.scrape "demo" {
    targets    = discovery.puppetdb.example.targets
    forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.demo.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "demo" {
    endpoint {
        url = "<PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>"

        basic_auth {
            username = "<USERNAME>"
            password = "<PASSWORD>"
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the following:

* _`<PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL>`_: The URL of the Prometheus remote_write-compatible server to send metrics to.
* _`<USERNAME>`_: The username to use for authentication to the `remote_write` API.
* _`<PASSWORD>`_: The password to use for authentication to the `remote_write` API.
