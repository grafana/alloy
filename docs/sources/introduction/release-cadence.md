# Release cadence

A new minor release is planned every six weeks for {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}.

The release cadence is best-effort.
If necessary, releases may be performed outside of this cadence, or a scheduled release date can be moved forwards or backwards.

Minor releases published on cadence include updating dependencies for upstream OpenTelemetry Collector code if new versions are available.
Minor releases published outside of the release cadence may not include these dependency updates.

Patch and security releases may be created at any time.
