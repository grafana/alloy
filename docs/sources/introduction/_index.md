# Introduction to {{% param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" %}}

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is a flexible, high performance, vendor-neutral distribution of the [OpenTelemetry][] (OTel) Collector.
It's fully compatible with the most popular open source observability standards such as OpenTelemetry (OTel), Prometheus, and .

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} focuses on ease-of-use and the ability to adapt to the needs of power users.

## Key features

Some of the key features of {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} include:

* **Custom components:** You can use {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to create and share custom components.
  Custom components combine a pipeline of existing components into a single, easy-to-understand component that's just a few lines long.
  You can use pre-built custom components from the community, ones packaged by Grafana, or create your own.
* **Reusable components:** You can use the output of a component as the input for multiple other components.
* **Chained components:** You can chain components together to form a pipeline.
* **Single task per component:** The scope of each component is limited to one specific task.
* **GitOps compatibility:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} uses frameworks to pull configurations from Git, S3, HTTP endpoints, and just about any other source.
* **Clustering support:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} has native clustering support.
  Clustering helps distribute the workload and ensures you have high availability.
  You can quickly create horizontally scalable deployments with minimal resource and operational overhead.
* **Security:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} helps you manage authentication credentials and connect to HashiCorp Vaults or Kubernetes clusters to retrieve secrets.
* **Debugging utilities:** {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides troubleshooting support and an embedded [user interface][UI] to help you identify and resolve configuration problems.
