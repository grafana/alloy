# Why choose {{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}}

Organizations worldwide adopt {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to modernize their observability infrastructure, reduce operational complexity, and strengthen their telemetry collection strategy.

## The observability collection challenge

Modern organizations handle complex observability requirements that traditional tools struggle to address efficiently.

As organizations scale their infrastructure, they encounter multiple telemetry collection challenges:

- **Complex tool sprawl**: Managing separate agents for metrics, logs, traces, and profiles creates significant operational overhead.
  Each tool requires different configurations, monitoring approaches, and expertise to maintain effectively.
- **Vendor lock-in**: Purpose-built collectors tie you to specific observability vendors, limiting your flexibility to change backends or adopt new technologies.
  This dependency can restrict your ability to optimize costs and functionality.
- **Limited flexibility**: Static configuration files make it difficult to adapt collection strategies to changing requirements.
  Dynamic environments need configuration approaches that can respond to runtime conditions and business logic.
- **Scaling challenges**: Traditional agents struggle with high-cardinality data and large-scale deployments.
  They often lack built-in clustering capabilities and require complex external orchestration for high availability.
- **Operational complexity**: Different tools require different expertise, monitoring, and maintenance approaches.
  This fragmentation increases the learning curve for teams and makes troubleshooting more difficult.

{{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}} addresses these challenges by providing a unified, vendor-neutral collection platform that scales with your observability needs.

## Key advantages over alternatives

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} delivers significant advantages over traditional observability collection tools through its modern architecture and comprehensive feature set.

### Unified collection platform

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides native support for all telemetry signals in a single binary with consistent operational patterns.
Instead of managing Prometheus for metrics, Fluent Bit for logs, and OpenTelemetry Collector for traces, you get one tool.
This unified approach means one configuration language, one operational model, and one set of skills for your team to master.

### Built-in enterprise clustering

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes automatic workload distribution without requiring external dependencies or complex orchestration.
The peer-to-peer protocol in {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} enables automatic peer discovery and coordination.
Consistent hashing ensures even load distribution across cluster nodes with self-healing cluster topology that adapts to changes automatically.

### Programmable configuration

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} offers a rich expression language that enables dynamic configuration and data transformation capabilities.
Instead of static YAML configurations, you can express complex logic with built-in functions.
This approach supports runtime evaluation of dynamic values and enables reusable modular configurations that adapt to changing conditions.

### Ecosystem compatibility

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} follows a "big tent" philosophy that provides native support for multiple observability ecosystems without requiring conversion or translation overhead.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes both OpenTelemetry and Prometheus pipelines in one tool.
It provides direct integration with Grafana Loki, Tempo, Mimir, and Pyroscope, ensuring connectivity across your observability stack.

## When to choose {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}

### Legacy monitoring modernization

Replace multiple specialized agents and collectors with a unified solution that handles all telemetry types.
This consolidation reduces operational complexity while providing access to modern features like clustering and programmable pipelines.
You can gradually migrate from legacy tools without disrupting your current monitoring capabilities.

### Observability infrastructure scaling

Start with a single instance and grow to enterprise-scale deployments without requiring architectural changes or redesign.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} clustering automatically distributes workload as you add capacity.
This elastic scaling approach ensures your observability infrastructure grows seamlessly with your business needs.

### Observability ecosystem integration

Connect OpenTelemetry applications with Prometheus infrastructure, or send Prometheus metrics to OpenTelemetry backends without complex configuration.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides native support for both ecosystems, eliminating conversion overhead and simplifying your observability architecture.
This dual compatibility ensures you can work with best-of-breed tools from multiple ecosystems.

### Cloud-native observability deployment

Deploy {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} on Kubernetes with native resource discovery, automatic configuration updates, and seamless cloud provider integration.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is purpose-built for containerized environments, providing service discovery and dynamic configuration management that adapts to your cloud-native infrastructure changes automatically.

## Migration benefits
