# Why choose {{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}}

Organizations worldwide adopt {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to modernize their observability infrastructure, reduce operational complexity, and future-proof their telemetry collection strategy.

## The observability collection challenge

Modern organizations handle complex observability requirements that traditional tools struggle to address efficiently.

As organizations scale their infrastructure, they encounter multiple telemetry collection challenges:

- **Complex tool sprawl**: Managing separate agents for metrics, logs, traces, and profiles creates operational overhead.
- **Vendor lock-in**: Purpose-built collectors tie you to specific observability vendors.
- **Limited flexibility**: Static configuration files make it difficult to adapt collection strategies.
- **Scaling challenges**: Traditional agents struggle with high-cardinality data and large-scale deployments.
- **Operational complexity**: Different tools require different expertise, monitoring, and maintenance approaches.

{{< param "FULL_PRODUCT_NAME" >}} addresses these challenges by providing a unified, vendor-neutral collection platform that scales with your observability needs.

## Key advantages over alternatives

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} delivers significant advantages over traditional observability collection tools through its modern architecture and comprehensive feature set.

### Unified collection platform

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} provides native support for all telemetry signals in a single binary with consistent operational patterns.
Instead of managing Prometheus for metrics, Fluent Bit for logs, and OpenTelemetry Collector for traces, you get one tool with one configuration language and one operational model.

### Built-in enterprise clustering

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes automatic workload distribution without external dependencies.
The peer-to-peer protocol in {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} enables automatic peer discovery and coordination, while consistent hashing ensures even load distribution with self-healing cluster topology.

### Programmable configuration

Rich expression language enables dynamic configuration and data transformation.
Instead of static YAML configurations, you can express complex logic with built-in functions, runtime evaluation of dynamic values, and reusable modular configurations.

### Ecosystem compatibility

The "big tent" philosophy provides native support for multiple observability ecosystems.
{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} includes both OpenTelemetry and Prometheus pipelines in one tool, with direct integration to Grafana Loki, Tempo, Mimir, and Pyroscope.

## When to choose {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}

### Legacy monitoring modernization

Replace multiple specialized agents and collectors with a unified solution.
Reduce operational complexity while gaining modern features like clustering and programmable pipelines.

### Observability infrastructure scaling

Start with a single instance and grow to enterprise-scale deployments without architectural changes.
Clustering automatically distributes workload as you add capacity.

### Observability ecosystem integration

Connect OpenTelemetry applications with Prometheus infrastructure, or send Prometheus metrics to OpenTelemetry backends.
Native support for both ecosystems eliminates conversion overhead.

### Cloud-native observability deployment

Deploy on Kubernetes with native resource discovery, automatic configuration updates, and seamless cloud provider integration.
Purpose-built for containerized environments.

## Migration benefits

### From OpenTelemetry Collector

- Add Prometheus support without additional tools
- Gain clustering and high availability features
- Access advanced configuration capabilities
- Use built-in converter to translate existing configurations

### From Prometheus Agent

- Extend beyond metrics to logs, traces, and profiles
- Eliminate separate log and trace collection tools
- Gain enterprise clustering and scalability features
- Direct replacement with enhanced capabilities

### From vendor-specific agents

- Escape vendor lock-in and gain backend flexibility
- Reduce licensing costs with open source solution
- Access rapidly evolving feature set and community
- Extensive component library covers most proprietary agent capabilities
