# Files

River files are plain text files with the `.river` file extension.
You can refer to each River file as a "configuration file" or a "River configuration."

River files must be UTF-8 encoded and can contain Unicode characters.
River files can use Unix-style line endings (LF) and Windows-style line endings (CRLF), but formatters may replace all line endings with Unix-style ones.
